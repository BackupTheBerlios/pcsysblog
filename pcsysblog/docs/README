PCSysBlog is designed to be a very simplistic blogging system. It is not
intended to compete with *nuke, xoops, slash, etc...

I created PCSysBlog because those systems and most of the blog software out
was way more than I needed for what I wanted to do.

This software probably barely qualifies as alpha testing, and as such, should
not be used on a publicly hosted server. It should most definitely not be
used on a production server, where you might require your data to be safe :-).
If you choose to test/use PCSysBlog, you do so at your own risk. I will not be
responsible if you get hacked, destroy data, or if your computer explodes.
Also, keep in mind that ANYONE can currently post to this blog system. The only
way to delete posts is to delete them manually from the database.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

PCSysBlog requires a Linux server running Apache/PHP/MySQL. I test/develop
on Debian GNU/Linux "sarge" using Apache 2.0.49, PHP 4.3.4, and MySQL 4.0.18.
If you get PCSysBlog working under different versions please let me know. If
it doesn't work under your system, let me know about that too. I may not do
anything about it, but then again who knows :-). If you get PCSysBlog
working on a system that it had problems on, please send the code and I will
try to get it incorporated into the next release (along with your name in
the contributors/developers list).
