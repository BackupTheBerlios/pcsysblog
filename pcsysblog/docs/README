PCSysBlog is designed to be a very simplistic blogging system.

I created PCSysBlog because most of the blog software out there was way more
than I needed for what I wanted to do.

This software probably barely qualifies as beta testing, and as such, should
not be used on a publicly hosted server. It should most definitely not be
used on a production server, where you might require your data to be safe :-).
If you choose to test/use PCSysBlog, you do so at your own risk. I will not be
responsible if you get hacked, destroy data, or if your computer explodes.
No security auditing has been done on PCSysBlog as of yet! Currently, the only
way to delete posts is to delete them manually from the database.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

PCSysBlog requires a Linux server running Apache/PHP/MySQL. I test/develop
on Ubuntu 5.04 using Apache 2.0.53, PHP 4.3.10, and MySQL 4.0.23.
If you get PCSysBlog working under different versions please let me know. If
it doesn't work under your system, let me know about that too. I may not do
anything about it, but then again who knows :-). If you get PCSysBlog
working on a system that it had problems on, please send the code and I will
try to get it incorporated into the next release (along with your name in
the contributors/developers list).
