Currently there is no installation system for PCSysBlog. Thats mostly because
I haven't coded one yet, but also, there isn't a heck of alot here yet.

Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    Untar/bunzip the file pcsysblog-x.x.x into your web directory:

	tar xvfj pcsysblog-x.x.x
      
      This will create a directory called pcsysblog-x.x.x. You can move/rename
      this directory to whatever you want or put its subdirectories/files under
      the root web directory.

2.    Create a database named pcsysblog and get the appropriate permissions
      If you choose to change the database name, be sure to update
      includes/dbconnect.php.

3.    cd into the db directory and dump the file pcsysblog.sql into your
      database:

	cd db/
	mysql -u 'username' pcsysblog < pcsysblog.sql

4.    Edit the file includes/dbconnect.php. You need to set the $dbhost,
      $dbusername, $dbpassword, and $database_name (if you used a different database name).

5.    Edit the file common.inc, as annotated, to reflect your site.

6.    Thats it. Point your browser to the following location:
	http://wherever_you_put_pcsysblog/index.php

Currently there is no facility for modifying anything about the page layout
including headers and footers. If you have gotten this far you should be
able to modify those by hand.
