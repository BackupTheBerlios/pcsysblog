Currently there is only a rudimentary installation system for PCSysBlog, mainly because
there isn't a heck of alot here yet. All that it will do is create your database and
your administrator.

Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    Untar/bunzip the file pcsysblog-x.x.x into your web directory:

	tar xvfj pcsysblog-x.x.x
      
      This will create a directory called pcsysblog-x.x.x. You can move/rename
      this directory to whatever you want or put its subdirectories/files under
      the root web directory.

2.    Open install/install.php and modify $dbhost, $dbusername, $dbuserpass, $dbname
      to match your site.

3.    Open includes/dbconnect.php and modify $dbhost, $dbusername, $dbuserpass, and
      $dbname with the same values you used in install/install.php.

4.    Open includes/common.inc and modify to reflect your site.

5.    Point your browser to http://wherever_you_put_pcsysblog/install/ and follow the
      input your information. Upon completion you should see the following:
        
        "PCSysBlog installation Successful!"

6.    Thats it. Point your browser to the following location:
      http://wherever_you_put_pcsysblog/index.php or click the link.

7.    IMPORTANT! Be sure to delete the entire install directory.

Currently there is no facility for modifying anything about the page layout
including headers and footers. If you have gotten this far you should be
able to modify those by hand. Eventually the installer will handle the editing of the files
you had to modify by hand.
